The Kipunji faces a number of significant threats, including habitat loss through logging and charcoal-making, habitat fragmentation, and illegal hunting for food and in retaliation for crop-raiding. Many subpopulations are small and isolated, and are unlikely to be viable in the long-term.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003eThe Kipunji is an important flagship species for conservation in and around Rungwe-Kitulo, and occurs entirely within protected areas, although only Kitulo National Park has any current management activities, and these remain limited. The effective protection and restoration of its habitat, and in particular of connecting forest 'corridors', together with ongoing population monitoring and public education, will be vital if this unique monkey is to survive.\\\"\", \r\n        \"FID\" : 61\r\n      }, \r\n      \"geometry\" : \r\n      {\r\n        \"x\" : 3750197.7975382763, \r\n        \"y\" : -1020382.4884374747\r\n      }\r\n    }, \r\n    {\r\n      \"attributes\" : {\r\n        \"OBJECTID\" : 59, \r\n        \"TaxonID\" : 169395, \r\n        \"Common_name\" : \"Tequila Splitfin\", \r\n        \"Latin_name\" : \"Zoogoneticus tequila\", \r\n        \"MapClass\" : \"Fish\", \r\n        \"Kingdom\" : \"ANIMALIA\", \r\n        \"Class\" : \"ACTINOPTERYGII\", \r\n        \"_Order\" : \"CYPRINODONTIFORMES\", \r\n        \"Family\" : \"GOODEIDAE\", \r\n        \"RLcategory\" : \"CR\", \r\n        \"RLdescrpt\" : \"Critically endangered\", \r\n        \"Longitude\" : -103.779, \r\n        \"Latitude\" : 20.7916, \r\n        \"Photo_URL\" : \"169395_Zoogoneticus_tequila.jpg\", \r\n        \"Thumb_URL\" : \"169395_Zoogoneticus_tequila_s.jpg\", \r\n        \"RedListURL\" : \"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/169395\", \r\n        \"ArkiveURL\" : \"http://www.arkive.org/Tequila-Splitfin/Zoogoneticus-tequila\", \r\n        \"Description\" : \"\\\"The Tequila Splitfin is listed as 'Critically Endangered' on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Its original decline in the Teuchitl�n River has been attributed to the introduction of exotic fish and habitat degradation due to the building of a dam. Native fish populations have also been fragmented, as the springs they were confined to have been turned into spas. In addition, the Tequila Splitfin is under threat from intensive collection for the aquarium trade, and by pollution and water extraction in its one remaining pool.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\u003cbr\\u003eThe Tequila Splitfin is kept in captivity in North America and Europe, and a breeding programme has been recommended so that the species can be re-introduced into further, larger pools.
